# Introduction to variants

**Variants** are custom setup packages for your prototypes. You run them just once, when you first create your protoype.

Variants give prototype designers a quick starting point with no additional configuration. They can include [plugins](/plugins/), starting pages, and Protoype Manager configurations. 

Variants are particularly useful for teams that need to maintain consistency in their prototyping process.

This section describes how to use variants when you create prototypes, and how to create your own variants for others to use.
