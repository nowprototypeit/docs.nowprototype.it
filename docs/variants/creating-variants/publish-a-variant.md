# Publish your variant

When your variant is finished and has successfully passed all tests, you can publish it as an NPM package.

## Before you start

Before you publish your variant, make sure you: 

* [Test your variant](/variants/creating-variants/test-a-variant)
* Update the `version` field in your `package.json` file, to ensure that users get the latest version of your variant.  

## Publish your variant

Use the command `npm publish` when you're ready to publish. 

> **Note**: If you're unfamiliar with the process of publishing NPM packages, see [NPM's documentation on publishing packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-publish).
