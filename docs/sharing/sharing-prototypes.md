# Share your prototype

You can share your prototype to collaborate with others, or to run prototype testing sessions for user research. 

You can share your prototype via the Prototype Manager. 

## Before you start

Before you can share a prototype, you need to: 

* Reach out to us to request access to the sharing platform. Please email support@nowprototype.it to request access to the sharing platform.
* Enable the sharing platform.

### Enable the sharing platform

To enable sharing:

1. Run your prototype and open the Prototype Manager
1. Go to Settings > Experimental
1. Under **Show the hosting tab in Manage Prototype**, select **On**.

## Share a prototype

Now that you've enabled sharing, a new **Hosting** tab should be available in the Prototype Manager.

1. Select **Hosting**
2. If required, log in to your Now Prototype It account
3. In the **Name of prototype** text field, enter the name of your prototype. [This must be the name you gave the prototype when you first created it.]
