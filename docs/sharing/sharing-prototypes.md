# Share your prototype

To share and test your prototype, you need to store it somewhere that allows other people to access it.

Now Prototype It manages sharing your prototype via **NPI Cloud**, a cloud sharing platform that you can use in your browser. With NPI Cloud, you can share interactive instances of your prototype using a single URL.

This page describes how to enable and use NPI Cloud.

**Note**: If you prefer to manage sharing and hosting internally or elsewhere, we can support you with this. See [Support Services](https://nowprototype.it/support#/) for details.

## Before you start

Before you can share a prototype, you need to: 

* Get access to NPI Cloud. Please [email us](mailto:support@nowprototype.it) to request access.
* Enable NPI Cloud.


To enable NPI Cloud:

1. [Run your prototype](/latest/prototypes/run-prototype-locally) and open the Prototype Manager.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Experimental**.
1. Enable **Show the hosting tab in Manage Prototype**.

This adds NPI Cloud access to your Prototype Manager. 

## Upload a prototype

Now that you've enabled NPI Cloud, a new **Hosting** tab should be available in the Prototype Manager.

1. Select **Hosting**.
2. If required, log in to your Now Prototype It account.
3. In the **Name of prototype** text field, give your prototype a name. This name will appear in the URL for your prototype.
4. Select **Upload prototype**. 

Keep your browser open while NPI sets up your prototype. 

When your prototype is ready, NPI provides a preview URL, so that you can check your prototype is running as expected.

## Share a prototype

There are two ways to share a NPI prototype:

* A single-use link, which can only be used once
* A reusable link, which can be used multiple times and by multiple users

To generate these links:

1. Log into your [NPI account](https://nowprototype.it/account#/) and go to [Uploaded prototypes](https://nowprototype.it/account/prototypes#/). 
1. From the list, select the prototype you want to share.
1. In the **Generate links** section, select the type of link you want to generate.
