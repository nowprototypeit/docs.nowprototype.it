# Setup

Get set up to work with Now Prototype It.

Now Prototype It is an open-source project that you can run on your computer or laptop, as long as you have the right tools installed. 

## Required tools

You need to have the following tools installed:

- A supported version of Node.js (currently versions 20 and 22). Node.js can be downloaded from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- Git, which can be downloaded from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

You don’t need to download Now Prototype It manually. Instead, when you [create a prototype](/create-prototype), you run a single command that temporarily downloads it, creates a prototype on your machine, and then discards the download. This saves space, and ensures you’re always using the latest version.

You are now ready to use Now Prototype It!

## Troubleshooting

If you can't install Node.js locally, [get in touch for support](mailto:support@nowprototype.it).

If you're still stuck after installing Node.js and Git, you can:
