# Create prototype pages

To create a page for your prototype, you can either use an existing page template from a plug-in, or create a new file in your local directory.

## Before you start

Before you create a new prototype page, make sure you:

* [Run your prototype locally](/prototypes/run-prototype-locally), so that you can test as you go.
* Install any [plugins](/plugins) you need, if you want to use existing page templates.

## Create a page from a page template

To create a page from an existing page template: 

1. Open the Prototype Manager
2. Go to **Templates**
3. Find the page template you want to use. Select **View** to preview the page template, and **Create** to create a new file from that page template.

## Create a page from a new file

To create a brand new page without using a page template: 

1. Create a new file. Prototype pages can be in `.html`, `.htm`, or `.njk`.
2. Save that file to your prototype's `/apps/views` directory. 

The file should automatically appear in your browser. To test it, go to `http://localhost:3000/your-file-name`.
