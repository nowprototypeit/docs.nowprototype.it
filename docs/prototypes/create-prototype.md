# Create a new prototype

This guide explains how to create a blank prototype, and a prototype with a variant. 

If you'd like to experiment with an existing prototype first, see [Try a demo prototype](/getting-started/try-demo-prototype).

## Before you start

Before you create a new prototype, make sure you:

* Install the prerequisite tools listed in the [Setup](/getting-started/setup) documentation.
* See [Introduction to prototypes](/prototypes) for details on the structure of a prototype, and what you can do with them.

You don’t need to download Now Prototype It manually. Instead, you run a single command that temporarily downloads it, creates a prototype on your machine, and then discards the download. This saves space, and ensures you’re always using the latest version.

## Create a new prototype

To create a blank protoype using the default settings, open the command line and run the following command (replace `prototype-name` with a name):

```
npx nowprototypeit create prototype-name
```

The default configuration includes essential features like Nunjucks templating, SASS styling, and JavaScript functionality.

## Create a prototype with a variant

Variants are pre-configured setups that include various features and tools to help you prototype quickly. If your organisation  already has a variant, you can specify it when you create a prototype. 

To specify a variant, you add `--variant` to your command, like this:

```
npx nowprototypeit create --variant variant-name prototype-name
```

See [Variants](/variants) for more information.
