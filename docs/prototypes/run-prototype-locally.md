# Run your prototype locally

Run your prototype locally at any time to view it in the browser, and to access the Prototype Manager.

## Before you start

* Open the command line in your prototype's root directory

## Run your prototype

1. In the command line, enter `npm run dev`. 
1. The prototype should now be running. To test this, go to the URL displayed in the command line (by default, this is `http://localhost:3000`)
