# Introduction to plugins

**Plugins** are configuration packages that you can add to your prototype at any time. They're useful for adding design system compatibility, page templates, and styles to your prototype.

You can create your own plugins, or use plugins that somebody else has created.

This section describes what plugins are, how to create them, and how to work with them.
